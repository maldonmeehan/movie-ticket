# Movie Ticket

##### Epicodus Section: JavaScript OO - Address Book

#### By Maldon Meehan and Halle Williams, June 15, 2016

## Description

This is an Epicodus student project to create a webpage where a user can select the name of a movie, the time of day that they would like to see the movie and their age. The webpage will let them know how much their movie ticket will cost, based on those three factors. Consider that non-"first-release" movies, matinee and senior tickets tend to be cheaper than the regular priced ticket.

* This is a lesson to use constructor and prototypes.

## Specifictions
